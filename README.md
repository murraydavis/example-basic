# Example Basic
========

This repository has just 5 basic commits on master by three different coders, providing a basic commit structure for learning exploring Git commands.

Added and configured for 'pat'.
Then setup credential caching.
Then erased the cache so that I would still be prompted for the 'pat'.

## Usage

* Using `git log` to review simple history
* Filtering `git log` with `--author` option
